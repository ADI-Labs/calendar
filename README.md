Calendar
---

Calendar is a project to provide easy access to campus events at a centralized location.

## Development Setup
We use [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) to run our server. First install vagrant, and then run `vagrant up` to provision the virtual machine for you.

Once vagrant is setup, run:
```bash
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
source config/settings.dev
```
and you should be good to go.

## Local Dev

To setup the database, run
```bash
python create.py
```

To run the server, run:
```bash
python run.py
````
