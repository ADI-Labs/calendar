Calendar
---

Calendar is a project to provide easy access to campus events at a centralized location.




## Local Dev

This is the recommend means of setting up Calendar for development.
Next, install [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/).
Once vagrant is installed, you can run `vagrant up`, and vagrant will provision the virtual machine for you.

To run the app, follow the these steps:

```bash
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
source config/settings.dev
python run.py
```

To setup the database, run:
```bash
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
source config/settings.dev
python create.py
=======
```
